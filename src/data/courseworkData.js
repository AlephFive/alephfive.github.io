No background in programming is presumed. Students learn how numbers are stored and manipulated on the computer in order to do mathematics (from calculus to linear algebra to exploring patterns in the integers), how mathematical functions can be encoded and presented, and how data relates to functions. Induction and continuity are methods of proof relying on infinity, yet will be explored using the finite number cruncher called a computer. The results provide examples and intuition for further mathematical investigation. The required lab portion of the course allows students to implement these ideas in practice.',

The ancient Greeks noted the existence of right triangles with sides of integral length, corresponding to equations such as 32 + 42 = 52 and 52 + 122 = 132. Is there a way of describing all such “Pythagorean Triples”? As another example, 5 = 12 + 22, 13 = 22 + 32, 17 = 12 + 42, while none of the primes 7, 11, or 19 can be expressed as the sum of two squares. Is there a pattern? Does it continue forever? This course focuses on such equations as a means for introducing students to the spirit and methods of modern mathematics. The emphasis throughout is on developing the ability to construct logically sound mathematical arguments and communicate these arguments in writing.',
