We will be reading, presenting, and discussing research papers that cover both the foundations and the frontiers of HCI. The papers represent many research areas within HCI: ubiquitous computing, mobile health, interaction techniques, social computing, mixed reality, accessibility, policy, and more. We will discuss both the papers and the research process behind them — both the substance and soul of HCI research. Students will practice giving research presentations and will complete an original HCI research project as part of the course. Our weekly meetings will focus on presentations, discussion, and project feedback.',
