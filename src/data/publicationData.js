      'Towards a Generalized Acoustic Minimap for Visually Impaired Gamers',
    abstract:
      'Video games created for visually impaired players (VIPs) remain inequivalent to those created for sighted players. Sighted players use minimaps within games to learn how their surrounding environment is laid out, but there is no effective analogue to the minimap for visually impaired players. A major accessibility challenge is to create a generalized, acoustic (non-visual) version of the minimap for VIPs. To address this challenge, we develop and investigate four acoustic minimap techniques which represent a breadth of ideas for how an acoustic minimap might work: a companion smartphone app, echolocation, a directional scanner, and a simple menu. Each technique is designed to communicate information about the area around the player within a game world, providing functionality analogous to a visual minimap but in acoustic form. We close by describing a user study that we are performing with these techniques to investigate the factors that are important in the design of acoustic minimap tools.',

      'IRelics: Designing a Tangible Interaction Platform for the Popularization of Field Archaeology',
    abstract:
      'We present IRelics, a tangible interaction platform for the popularization of field archeology. IRelics allows users to experience archaeological field work activities as a serious game by using a set of tangible tools. We developed an innovative LWIR (Long Wavelength Infrared Rays) sensing system, which implements the design of tangible tools that provide real manipulation experiences. By interacting with IRelics, a player may experience different archaeological activities such as excavation and cleaning. We conducted two observations to evaluate the usability and effectiveness at archeology popularizing. Findings suggest that the IRelics platform can enhance the engagement of the participants by providing a positive and interactive environment while teaching them unfamiliar knowledge.',
