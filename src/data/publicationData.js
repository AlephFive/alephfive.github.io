      'IRelics: Designing a Tangible Interaction Platform for the Popularization of Field Archaeology',
    abstract:
      'We present IRelics, a tangible interaction platform for the popularization of field archeology. IRelics allows users to experience archaeological field work activities as a serious game by using a set of tangible tools. We developed an innovative LWIR (Long Wavelength Infrared Rays) sensing system, which implements the design of tangible tools that provide real manipulation experiences. By interacting with IRelics, a player may experience different archaeological activities such as excavation and cleaning. We conducted two observations to evaluate the usability and effectiveness at archeology popularizing. Findings suggest that the IRelics platform can enhance the engagement of the participants by providing a positive and interactive environment while teaching them unfamiliar knowledge.',
